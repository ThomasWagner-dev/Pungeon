## General info
This a simple top down Roguelike game based on Greenfoot.  


## Technologies 
Project created with:  
Java 12  
No longer Greenfoot: 3.6.0  
Python 3.9.0
Way too much pain

## Setup
Download the Pungeon.jar file. (includes full source code and documentation)
or download the Pungeon_light.jar (only compiled code)
Install Java 12 from somewhere on the internet.  
Run the jar file either via double-click or 'java -jar Pungeon.jar'   
Annotation when running the jar for the first time:
Extracting the assets may take (a literal) minute. Don't worry if nothing is happening.
If you have any idea how to improve the extraction to make it faster, message us.


## Addon scripts
The addonscripts (mapbuilder, nbt_injector) are scripts, written in python.
They are NOT required for the game to work, but are tools for the devs and modders to create new weapons, maps etc. more easily.

## data.nbt
the file data.nbt stores all data except save files. This includes weapons, items, enemies, the world and a lot more. 
NBT or Named Binary Tag is a file format used by the game Minecraft and can be opened using an nbtexplorer such as [NBTExplorer](https://github.com/jaquadro/NBTExplorer/releases/tag/v2.8.0-win)

## Noised map generation
The rooms of the dungeon don't always look the same. They differ each time the game is started (aka the screens are cashed).
This is due to generation noise (defined in the data.nbt) and is applied when the map is generated.
